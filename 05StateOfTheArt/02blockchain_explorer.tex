\subsection{Blockchain explorers}
Generally, it is not possible to learn about status of a blockchain (Ethereum, Bitcoin or other) unless we launch a node that directly participates in the blockchain by receiving, verifying and forwarding blocks. However, it is not always feasible to run such a node, due to the limitations mentioned earlier (Section \ref{sec:eth-clients}, p. \pageref{sec:eth-clients}). If we do not need to deploy any transactions to the network, but only need to receive information from it, we can use a \textit{blockchain explorer}.

A blockchain explorer is a service that participates in the blockchain and exposes its information publicly, so that even parties that are not running a network node can see the information contained in the blockchain\footnotemark. Such information may include transactions, unspent outputs, deployed contracts and other data, usually only visible to participating nodes.

\footnotetext{At the time of writing, there is no consensus on the use of terms \textit{blockchain explorer} and \textit{block explorer}. Websites offering such services use these terms to market themselves. On the other hand other papers, such as \cite{Kuzuno2017BlockchainBitcoin} use these terms in a different context.}

General cryptocurrency users and services built on top of the blockchain are the most common users of the blockchain explorers\footnotemark.

There are several providers that offer blockchain explorer services. Web interfaces, allowing users to search for and browse transactions and addresses, as well as \acrshort{api}s offering limited number of methods defined by JSON-RPC, are both common practices. Some examples on of providers offering these services are \textit{Blockchain}\footnote{To avoid confusion with the concept of the blockchain as a distributed ledger, we will refer to this provider as \textit{Blockchain.info} for the rest of this report.

or Ethplorer\footnote{\url{https://ethplorer.io/}, accessed 21-05-2018} on the Ethereum network. Table \ref{tab:block-explorers} sumarizes the examples on both networks. Infura could also be used as a blockchain explorer, since it is hosted remotely and can provide data about blockchain.
