\section{State of the Art}\label{sec:SOTA}
% 
In the recent years, many innovative applications and systems have emerged that work with the Bitcoin, blockchain, smart contracts or other technologies described in the previous chapter. We now explore, which of these solutions could be relevant to the idea of a smart-contract-based currency exchange, and we use these leanings during the development of the system. We first look into implementations of the Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols and to services that allow exploration of the blockchain. Afterwards we review some of the existing smart contracts and the smart-contract-based applications. We investigate, how these applications interact with the outside world in the \textit{Oracles} section.
