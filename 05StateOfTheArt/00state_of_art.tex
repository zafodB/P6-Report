\section{State of the Art}\label{sec:SOTA}
% 
In recent years, many innovative applications and systems have emerged, that work with Bitcoin, blockchain, smart contracts or other technologies described in previous chapter. We now explore which of these solutions could be relevant to the idea of a smart-contract-based currency exchange and we use these leanings during the development of the system. We first look into implementations of the Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols and compare them with blockchain explorer services. After we consider some of the existing smart contracts and smart-contract-based applications. We investigate, how these applications interact with the outside world in the \textit{Oracles} section.
