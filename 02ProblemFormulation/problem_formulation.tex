\section{Problem Formulation}\label{sec:problem-formulation}
% 
The introduction presents a problem with current currency exchange scheme. The basic premise, attempting to solve this problem would be: ``\textit{How can trust in a third-party exchange provider be replaced with trust in the open cryptocurrency system?}''. However, this is too broad and could possibly include many different solutions. As mentioned previously, Ethereum would be worth investigating further. This leads us to another question: ``\textit{How can smart contracts be used to solve the trust problem?}'' Upon preliminary research on the idea, it was clear to us, that a smart contract alone could not solve the problem. We therefore reformulated the problem formulation into the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{How to implement an open, decentralised cryptocurrency exchange which operates on a decentralised ledger system?}
\end{itemize}

\noindent The motivation for this project stems from the fact, that people who wish to trade cryptocurrencies, do not currently have means how to engage in trade, without needing to trust a third party. While it is obvious, that not all cryptocurrency exchanges are inherently bad, they are a third party, that needs to be involved in a transaction. Naturally, users may just trade directly with each other, however this carries the risk, that one of the users does not keep their part of the agreement and does not transfer their funds. We propose a solution, that acts as an intermediary between two trading user, but is embedded in the cryptocurrency system. The logic of this solution needs to be open to anyone, so that whoever wishes to trade, can inspect how the system operates and can make an informed decision, whether such system is to be trusted or not. Such system should run in a decentralised manner, so that there is not a single entity that could prevent the transaction process. Decentralised ledger system enables this.
