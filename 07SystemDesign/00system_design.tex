\section{System Design}\label{sec:system-design}

In this chapter we analyse, how the cryptocurrency exchange process could be improved. We begin by presenting the current process and identifying the possible issues. We then attempt to find a solution to these issues, by presenting another version of the process. In similar fashion we continue until we reach an architecture where the most severe issues are resolved and which could be implemented in a technical system. There are three iterations of this process.
