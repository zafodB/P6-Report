\section{Methodology}
% 
In this section we will describe the methodology used through-out this project.

//Functional requirements and non-functional requirements.

Using FR to describe how the system will operate
 
begin by FR of the prototype: what functions are included? what parts of the idea are "business critical" - contract deployment
what it must do
what it might do
what it won't do (but should be in the market ready version)

then NFR of the prototype: how does the system behave
reqs - no single Point of failure
reqs - no "last minute pull outs" - once transaction is made, it is final
reqs - security - 3rd party cannot steal funds if part of the system fails
reqs - transparency - users need to be able to verify the process


Then:
each component:
Functional reqs: what it does

Non-functional reqs - how does it help to achieve the overall NFRs





YES ? NO MOSCOW
