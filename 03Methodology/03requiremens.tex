\subsection{Requirement engineering}

Requirement engineer is the process of defining and documenting requirements of a system~\cite{Sommerville2011SoftwareEngineering}. Requirements can be written down with various level of detail, ranging from high-level, general descriptions of the system (e.g. A system should be able to generate a report) to low-level detailed rules about the properties of a system (e.g. A system should generate a report in PDF format within 2 minutes after a user has pressed a button). 

As noted in the previous section, we use requirements in two places of this report. Firstly, we use high-level requirements to 

//WHAT DOES THIS INCLUDE?

//Functional requirements and non-functional requirements.

Using FR to describe how the system will operate
 
begin by FR of the prototype: what functions are included? what parts of the idea are "business critical" - contract deployment
what it must do
what it might do
what it won't do (but should be in the market ready version)

then NFR of the prototype: how does the system behave
