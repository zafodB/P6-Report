\subsection{Conclusion}

In this chapter we have identified the necessary components to support our desired transaction process, specified in the \textit{System Design} chapter. We specified functional and non-functional requirements for the system as a whole and for the individual components. We presented the final version of the architecture that we later implemented. We described implementation of all the parts and how they interact together.

In the \textit{Evaluation} section we have verified that the implemented system fulfils the requirement outlined earlier. We than proceeded to test the operation of the system in the model scenario. We can conclude that the implemented prototype is capable of carrying out the desired transaction, which was demonstrated in the scenario. At the end of this chapter we listed some known issues that would need to be addressed in the further development of the system. In the following chapter \textit{Discussion}, we debate the outcomes of the project.
