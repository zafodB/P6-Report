\section{Implementation and evaluation}
% 
In the prototype, we use the architecture described in Figure \ref{fig:arch-ver2-tech} as the basics for our system design. The idea of the project -- to exchange cryptocurrencies -- is too broad to be implemented without further refinements. To be able to implement the prototype, we need to break this idea down to a list of desired functions or functional requirements. Furthermore, the idea of this product includes some overall themes that the solution should follow, such as security and decentralisation. These \textit{themes} can be broken down to Non-functional requirements \acrshort{nfr}, which describe properties of the system. The further implementation work needs to consider these \acrshort{nfr}s.
