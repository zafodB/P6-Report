\section{Implementation and evaluation}\label{sec:implementation}
% 
In the prototype, we use the architecture described in Figure \ref{fig:arch-ver2-tech} as the basis for our system design. To be able to implement such a prototype, we need to break our idea down to a list of desired functions or functional requirements. Furthermore, the idea of this product includes some overall themes that the solution should follow, such as security and decentralisation. These \textit{themes} can be broken down to Non-functional requirements \acrshort{nfr}, which describe properties of the system.
